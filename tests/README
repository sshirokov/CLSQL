These tests require the setup of a configuration file with account
information for MySQL and PostgreSQL SQL servers. Additionally,
the Debian package acl-installer must be installed and a license downloaded
to use the AODBC tests.

This test suite looks for a configuration file named ".clsql-test.config"
located in the users home directory.

This file contains a single a-list that specifies the connection
 specs for each database type to be tested. For example, to test all
platforms, a sample file might look like this:

((:mysql ("localhost" "a-mysql-db" "user1" "secret"))
 (:aodbc ("my-dsn" "a-user" "pass"))
 (:postgresql ("localhost" "another-db" "user2" "dont-tell"))
 (:postgresql-socket ("pg-server" "a-db-name" "user" "secret-password")))
