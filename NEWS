the ChangeLog entry for details.


Aug 3 2006
----------
CLSQL 3.0 has been released. The 3.0 release of CLSQL is a major
rewrite compared to version 2.0. New features include:

 - Full CommonSQL backward compatibility with native documentation while
   retaining and adding many improvements beyond the CommonSQL 
   standard.
 - Extensive (233 tests) regression suite
 - Addition of ODBC and Oracle backends

I wish to acknowledge Marcus Pearce's significant contribution to this
release. He has performed the initial port of Uncommonsql to CLSQL as
well as the initial regression suite and most of the new
documentation. He has contributed to many of the re-design decisions
and new code for CLSQL.

Enjoy!
